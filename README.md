## HOW TO USE

Numbers get represented as numbers.

Constants get represented as a number, aka.: `3 + pi` = `6.14...`

Functions need to be written with round brackets after the name and with an expression inside them, aka.: `3 + round(4.5)` = `8`

Functions can be inside other functions.

Whitespaces are ignored entirely.
